            <h5 class="card-title"><b>School for Good and Evil</b></h5>
            <p class="card-text">This series didn't really impact me in any grandiose way. It's a twist on the fairy tale trope
                where the children of the big heroes/heroines attend either the School for Good, or the School for Evil, and learn how
                to be a proper villain/hero. There's nothing <em>bad</em> about it, per se, I think it just felt very juvenile. If I had read
                this book when I was younger, I would've loved it. As an adult, however, it just feels surface level- a lot of the morals and
                lessons are very much obvious, like, don't judge people based on appearances. Basic stuff. Regardless, it's a nice, light read
                if you're just looking to kill time. </p><br>

            <h5 class="card-title"><b>The Sun and The Star</b></h5>
            <p class="card-text">This one. Honestly, I would put it in Level 3, but out of loyalty to Rick, I must give it some
                leniency. It's about Will and Nico journeying through Tartarus to rescue their friend Bob, the Titan.
                I just found it to be very juvenile, again. The writing from the previous books was drastically better compared to this one.
                It was more nuanced and mature. This felt like something I'd read in fifth grade. I suppose his target audience is that range, so it
                makes sense. But still. A lot of the writing felt awkward and embarrassing, like they were trying too hard to sell the message of the
                power of love or whatever. It more-so focused on mental health and healing, which I do think is important for young children
                to read. I just think it could have been executed better. </p> <br>

            <h5 class="card-title"><b>Five Survive</b></h5>
            <p class="card-text"><em>Five Survive</em> was as good as a murder mystery can be. It's about a group of friends who get
                trapped in an RV while road-tripping. They find out they've been ambushed by a rogue, mystery man, and they have to figure out
                who it is, and what they want. Otherwise, they die. It was one of the better ones, in that I didn't
                immediately guess who was the suspect, but I found the writing to be clunky in the beginning. It fell into a flow nicely later on, though.
                It was predictable, but I think that most YA murder mysteries are kind of predictable though, so this book isn't unique in that.
                However, the main character's quirks are very noticeable, and they're never fully explained. I still don't know why she did some of the
                shit she did. The ending though, oh man. It made me so emotional; it really focused on the bond between a mother and daughter.
                It was so sweet, it made up for the mediocrity of the rest of it. <br>
