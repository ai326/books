            <p class="card-text">I don't think I've despised a book as much as I despise this one. The main character, Kiran's, sister is getting
                married to the brother of the guy she hates, Deen. This detail is irrelevant, mostly, because Kiran wants to break up the happy couple.
                Why? Because A) Faisal, (the brother) was previously a drug addict, (KEY WORD PREVIOUS), except Kiran thinks that he's not good
                enough for her sister, Amira. I understand why that could make her wary, but man, everyone has issues. And the fact that he worked through them,
                and is clearly trying every day to be good enough for Amira shows that he's not that same guy anymore. In fact, he is quite possibly
                the most gentle, loving man I've ever seen, and is clearly pathetically in love with her sister. So, to have Kiran immediately discount him
                because of his issues in the past honestly reflects more on her character than his. B) Kiran is extremely traumatized. Her mother died a few years ago,
                so now she's determined to keep her family together. She does this the only way she knows how, by preventing their marriage. I do
                pity her on this, because I can't imagine having to go through that trauma. I mean, it's just absolutely horrible. BUT. This does not
                give her a free pass to be a jerk! I think that's what irked me the most; Kiran just dumping her trauma on everyone else, even though
                everyone in this book has their own issues, but no one tries to sabotage anyone else because of it. What makes Kiran special?
                And the fact that there was no redemption arc, even after she royally screwed everything up? Nah. This book is truly the worst. <br>

            <p class="card-text">I probably haven't read enough of this book to properly critique it, but that's okay, because
                even the first few chapters made me hate it ðŸ˜€. The main character, Kiran, is determined to get in a relationship
                that won't disappoint her parents, after her sister's marriage did. But then she ends up falling in love with a white guy.
                SO. Heh. The premise itself seemed interesting enough, one, because of the angst, and two, since it seemed like both characters would work through their issues
                together. I love those kinds of plots-- the 'healing together' stuff. Alas, the writing made me want to scream. In a bad way. It was so
                horribly juvenile, and there was way too much telling instead of showing. I mean, isn't that the first writing tip you learn, in like, kindergarten?
                'Show don't tell', right? Well, this book failed at that abysmally. I also really hated the way they described the characters,
                it felt way too Wattpad-esque for my liking. Honestly, it was like something I'd have written in high-school. I really couldn't
                get through more than a few chapters.<br>

            <p class="card-text">This book isn't <em>bad</em>, I just think it tried too hard to be unpredictable. It's about Lylah
                and her group of friends trying to unwind after a stressful few weeks at school. They end up going out to this party,
                but just as they're about to leave, one of the friends, Sonny, gets an anonymous letter from a secret admirer saying some creepy
                shit. They laugh it off, but turns out, Sonny never comes home. He's dead. Now, this seemed like the perfect set up for a nice,
                freaky mystery, but the execution just felt off. First of all, the author kept making it incredibly obvious as to who the killer
                <em>IS NOT</em> by making it seem like it is that person, if that makes sense? She kept emphasizing that it's probably this one,
                random guy, with no motive whatsoever. It just made it incredibly obvious that it wasn't him. I understand that's a pretty normal
                technique in mystery novels, but it was just overdone here. Also, for no particular reason, I found the main character to be
                extremely whiny and annoying and 'oh someone, please protect me'. She just seemed overly ditzy for no particular reason. I also
                found the actual culprit to be more laughable than scary. I didn't sympathize with him, which I suppose is good, but I think
                the most well-written villains are the ones you can feel for. I just didn't get that from this. All in all, it just fell flat.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Final Rating: </b> âœ¨âœ¨/5 (it's alright for middle school children. It's not good for much else)</p>
