            <h5 class="card-title"><b>Keeper of The Lost Cities</b></h5>
            <p class="card-text">Objectively, I've read better quality books than this, but I feel like it would be blasphemous to not have
                this up top, so :). Seriously, though, I'd categorize it as Level 1 because I've now dedicated around seven years of my life to this series, so,
                it's definitely been life-changing in that way. It's one of the big three book series in my life that I can't imagine <em> not</em>
                reading. I don't remember what I did before finding this series. It's just so easy to get lost in it; it's the perfect comfort read
                because it isn't particularly heavy or sad-- it's just a light, exciting read. The premise is also pretty interesting: 12-year-old Sophie Foster
                realizes that she's a long,lost elf, and returns to the elvin world. Over there, she goes through a series of adventures and makes a bunch of friends, etc. (Yes, I'm aware it sounds stupid, but so did Harry Potter
                and look how that turned out) <br>
                <br>
                <b>Final Rating:</b> ✨✨✨✨✨/5 (because not everything has to be SO SERIOUS. Sometimes you just need a nice, light read)

            <h5 class="card-title"><b>Song of Achilles</b></h5>
            <p class="card-text">This book. Oh my god. This. Book. You don't know pain until you've read this book. To
                this day, I cannot reread it. I can't. It's the kind of book where everything hurts in hindsight, even they happy parts,
                so really, it's all just endless misery. It's about Achilles and his lover, Patroclus. It follows them from their first meeting
                as children, to the Trojan War. Dude. It ripped my heart out and then stomped on it. It's relentless, truly. Just when you think
                it has to get better-- it gets worse. But I enjoyed every second of it. The writing too, is honestly so beautiful. The way the words all flow together like silk,
                the vivid imagery-- it's so easy to get swept up in the book. You can almost hear the crashing of the waves, the birdsong, the
                fighting soldiers. It's truly one of the most beautiful books I've read, both in the sense of plot and writing style. <br>

            <h5 class="card-title"><b>All The Young Dudes</b></h5>
            <p class="card-text">Oh my god. Words cannot describe how much I adore this book. Technically, I know it's not a book,
                it's 'fanfic', yeah, yeah, shut up. Regardless, when I say this book has been life-changing for me, I mean it is LIFE-CHANGING
                I really don't know how I went by life without this to occupy me. I can't remember a time in the last year when I <em>haven't</em>
                thought about this book or these characters in some way. It follows Remus Lupin's (from Harry Potter) life from 1971-1995; basically,
                his entire time at Hogwarts, during the War, and up to Order of the Phoenix. The writing style is incredibly similar to Harry Potter, so it's
                the unofficial prequel series. I've always loved the Marauders, and this book fleshes them out so wonderfully.
                I feel like I know so much about these characters now, even if isn't technically canon. Specifically, Remus. He's always been my favorite
                character in HP, and this has just revived that with a vengeance. Really. Not a day goes by where I don't think about this fool.
                I've just been sucked into this Marauders/Wolfstar fan-fiction vortex ever since. And the Wolfstar! Oh god. It DESTROYED ME. Utterly.
                because you know how it all ends for them, so to see them all joyful and lively and stupidly in love is just heartbreaking.
                It's one of the most tragically beautiful stories I've ever read.<br>
                <br>

            <h5 class="card-title"><b>A Thousand Splendid Suns</b></h5>
            <p class="card-text"><em>A Thousand Splendid Suns</em> is truly one of the most poignant, impactful books I've ever read,
                but not in the way the previous books have been described. It's not all-consuming in the way ATYD or KOTLC is, rather, it really
                forces you to change the way you view the world. It follows the story of two young girls, Laila and Mariam, from the Soviet Invasion
                of Afghanistan to the Taliban's arrival. The things that they do to simply survive, -- it really paints such a beautiful story about
                what it means to be a woman, a mother, a sister, and the courage it takes to be one in a place where it is punishable by death.
                Honestly, it also made me so incredibly grateful to live a in a place where I have the freedom to leave the house, wear what I want to wear, etc,
                without fearing for my life or well-being. Or even simpler pleasures, like waking up in the morning with the certainty that you're not
                about to get bombed or shot down. This book really does such an amazing job and depicting life in Afghanistan during those turbulent times.
                Also. The writing! Again, like Song of Achilles, it's written so beautifully. The words flow together so well, it feels like poetry. It
                also has such an emotional impact; you will bawl, you will cheer, you will rage with these characters so fiercely, because you know
                that somewhere in Afghanistan right now, something just like this is happening, or has happened. It's such a powerful book.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Final Rating: </b> ✨✨✨✨✨/5  (although, five stars doesn't even do it justice. Like some of the others, I don't think
                I could put down as many stars as this book deserves.) </p>
